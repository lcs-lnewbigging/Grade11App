It is typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A grilled cheese may contain ingredients besides the bread and cheese, as long as the latter is the main focus.",
